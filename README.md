# sd-phone (THIS IS A BETA RELEASE, WILL HAVE ISSUES)

**An iOS-themed smartphone for FiveM. 45+ server-backed apps, real app accounts, a live game-view camera, online multiplayer games, and drop-in lb-phone compatibility.**

The phone is **NOT ready yet for use on a live server**, this is for people to play around with it, report bugs and make PRs to speed up it's development, I'm hoping to have it done by the end of July.

Thanks for trying this so early. I'd put the phone at about 85% done as of writing, so expect rough edges and a few gaps. Some apps are still mock-only or not fully wired up yet (Vibez, for example, has no backend at this point and only a mock frontend), and there's a good amount of polish and fixes left across the board

Any issues or PRs are highly appreciated.

## Overview

sd-phone is a complete smartphone experience: lockscreen with passcode and Face Unlock, customizable homescreen with a real app switcher, notification banners with persistent server-authoritative unread badges, and a full catalog of apps backed by their own server modules. The UI is a React app rendered inside a real iPhone bezel; the phone is held as an in-hand prop, tints to the colour of the phone item you used, and keeps working while you walk.

Everything player-facing is translatable, apps resume where you left them, and the phone auto-detects your framework, inventory, banking, housing, garage, and voice resources with zero config flags.

## Powered by Fivemanage

### sd-phone is partnered with Fivemanage for media hosting

The Camera, Photos and Voice Memos apps need somewhere to store what they capture. sd-phone uses **[Fivemanage](https://refer.fivemanage.com/samuel)** for that: every screenshot, camera video and voice recording uploads to Fivemanage and comes back as a fast CDN URL, so you never run your own media server. It is the CDN and logging platform trusted by thousands of FiveM servers.

**A free Fivemanage Media API token is required for photo, video and voice-note uploads to work.** In the Fivemanage dashboard open the Tokens tab, create a token of type **Media**, and paste it into `configs/server/apikeys.lua` under `FivemanageMedia`. Without a key the camera and recorders still open, but nothing uploads or saves.

<sub>The free tier is plenty for most servers.</sub>

## Apps

| | |
|---|---|
| **Communication** | Phone (1:1, group and company calls over pma-voice), Messages (SMS, group threads, GIFs, money and location cards), Mail (multi-account, global inboxes), Groups, Dark Chat, Radio, Find Friends |
| **Social** | Photogram (posts, stories, DMs, real live video streaming), Birdy, Cherry, Vibez, Streaks, all on a shared accounts engine with registration, sign-in, and password resets delivered in-game |
| **Camera & media** | Camera (live game view: photos, video with voice capture, selfie mode), Photos, Music (with AirShare library sharing), Voice Memos |
| **World** | Maps (CDN-streamed tiles, routing, pins), Garages, Homes, Wallet, Services (company directory, dispatch messaging, phone multijob), Ryde (player-to-player ride hailing), Weazel News, Pages, Marketplace, Review, Weather, Stocks |
| **Games** | Chess, Connect Four, Battleship and Wordle with online lobbies, plus Blackjack, Cookie, Flappy, Blocks, Climber and Rail Runner with server-side leaderboards |
| **Utilities** | Clock (alarms), Calendar, Notes (with sketches), Calculator, Compass, Health, Passwords, App Store, Settings |

## Highlights

- **Real accounts engine.** Social apps use actual registration and login, with verification codes and password resets delivered by in-game mail or SMS. Accounts are global, not per-character-slot.
- **Live game-view camera.** The Camera app renders the world into the phone screen in real time; video clips record your microphone and nearby players' voices.
- **Photogram Live.** Stream real encoded video to other players' phones, with clean late-joins.
- **Deep world integration.** Garages and Homes bridge across ten-plus garage and housing systems; Wallet reads your framework bank; Services maps jobs to callable, messageable companies; Weather mirrors the in-game sky.
- **Custom apps.** Other resources can put their own apps on the phone: one export call turns any webpage into an installable app with icons, badges, notifications, popups and an App Store listing. Custom apps built for lb-phone run unmodified. Start from the [app templates](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-app-templates) (plain JS, React JS/TS, Vue 3) and the [custom app guide](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/custom-apps).
- **lb-phone drop-in compatibility.** Third-party scripts written against lb-phone's exports and events keep working unmodified, and a one-command migrator imports lb-phone player data. See the [compatibility docs](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/lb-phone-compatibility).

## For developers

The phone ships a full integration surface, documented at [docs.samueldev.shop](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/):

- [Server exports](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/exports-server) for sending mail, messages and notifications, starting calls, managing contacts, resolving numbers to players, logging transactions, posting news, and more.
- [Client exports](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/exports-client) for opening the phone, deep-linking into apps, and gating phone use.
- [Custom apps](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/custom-apps) for shipping your own apps on the phone, with ready-made [templates](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-app-templates) for plain JS, React and Vue. Apps written for lb-phone register and run unmodified.
- [First-party events](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/events-server) on every lifecycle moment: messages, mail, calls, transactions, posts, contacts.
- [lb-phone compatibility](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/lb-phone-compatibility) covering exports, events, and `dependency 'lb-phone'` lines.

```lua
-- A taste: text a player from a job script
exports['sd-phone']:sendSystemMessage('555-0199', 'LS Dispatch', targetNumber, 'New tow request at Legion Square.')

-- React to any SMS being sent
AddEventHandler('sd-phone:server:messages:sent', function(m)
    print(('%s texted %s'):format(m.senderNumber, m.targetNumber))
end)
```

## Compatibility

| Layer | Supported |

| Voice | pma-voice |
| Housing | 9 housing systems for the Homes app |
| Garages | 10 garage systems for the Garages app |
| Notify | ox_lib (default), lation_ui (opt-in), framework-native fallback |

## Installation

Full guide: [docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/installation](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/installation)

**Dependencies:** [ox_lib](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_lib) · [oxmysql](https://github.com/CommunityOx/oxmysql) · [sd-phone-props](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-props) (streams the in-hand phone models)

1. Drop `sd-phone` and [`sd-phone-props`](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-props) into your resources folder and ensure them after `ox_lib` and `oxmysql`. Database tables create themselves on first boot.
2. Add the phone items to your inventory, one per frame colour (`phone_black`, `phone_blue`, `phone_green`, `phone_orange`, `phone_pink`, `phone_purple`, `phone_red`, `phone_yellow`). Ready-made ox_inventory definitions and item icons are in the [installation docs](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/installation); the icons ship in this repo's `images/` folder. Players can also open with the keybind (default F1), gated on owning a phone item.
3. Set your API keys in `configs/server/apikeys.lua`: a [Fivemanage](https://refer.fivemanage.com/samuel) token of type **Media** in `FivemanageMedia` (required for the Camera, Photos and Voice Memos apps to upload), and optionally a GIPHY key for the Messages GIF picker.

The pre-built UI ships at `web/build/`, so a fresh clone runs without touching npm. To rebuild after UI changes: `cd web && npm install && npm run build`.
