# sd-phone (THIS IS A BETA RELEASE, WILL HAVE ISSUES)

**An iOS-themed smartphone for FiveM. 45+ server-backed apps, real app accounts, a live game-view camera, online multiplayer games, and drop-in lb-phone compatibility.**

The phone is **NOT ready yet for use on a live server**, this is for people to play around with it, report bugs and make PRs to speed up it's development, I'm hoping to have it done by the end of July.

Thanks for trying this so early. I'd put the phone at about 85% done as of writing, so expect rough edges and a few gaps. Some apps are still mock-only or not fully wired up yet (Vibez, for example, has no backend at this point and only a mock frontend), and there's a good amount of polish and fixes left across the board

Any issues or PRs are highly appreciated.

## Overview

sd-phone is a complete smartphone experience: lockscreen with passcode and Face Unlock, customizable homescreen with a real app switcher, notification banners with persistent server-authoritative unread badges, and a full catalog of apps backed by their own server modules. The UI is a React app rendered inside a real iPhone bezel; the phone is held as an in-hand prop, tints to the colour of the phone item you used, and keeps working while you walk.

Everything player-facing is translatable, apps resume where you left them, and the phone auto-detects your framework, inventory, banking, housing, garage, and voice resources with zero config flags.

## Powered by Fivemanage

### sd-phone is partnered with Fivemanage for media hosting

The Camera, Photos and Voice Memos apps need somewhere to store what they capture. sd-phone uses **[Fivemanage](https://refer.fivemanage.com/samuel)** for that: every screenshot, camera video and voice recording uploads to Fivemanage and comes back as a fast CDN URL, so you never run your own media server. It is the CDN and logging platform trusted by thousands of FiveM servers.

**A free Fivemanage Media API token is required for photo, video and voice-note uploads to work.** In the Fivemanage dashboard open the Tokens tab, create a token of type **Media**, and paste it into `configs/server/apikeys.lua` under `FivemanageMedia`. Without a key the camera and recorders still open, but nothing uploads or saves.

<sub>The free tier is plenty for most servers.</sub>

## Apps

| | |
|---|---|
| **Communication** | Phone (1:1, group and company calls over pma-voice), Messages (SMS, group threads, GIFs, money and location cards), Mail (multi-account, global inboxes), Groups, Dark Chat, Radio, Find Friends |
| **Social** | Photogram (posts, stories, DMs, real live video streaming), Birdy, Cherry, Vibez, Streaks, all on a shared accounts engine with registration, sign-in, and password resets delivered in-game |
| **Camera & media** | Camera (live game view: photos, video with voice capture, selfie mode), Photos, Music (with AirShare library sharing), Voice Memos |
| **World** | Maps (CDN-streamed tiles, routing, pins), Garages, Homes, Wallet, Services (company directory, dispatch messaging, phone multijob), Ryde (player-to-player ride hailing), Weazel News, Pages, Marketplace, Review, Weather, Stocks |
| **Games** | Chess, Connect Four, Battleship and Wordle with online lobbies, plus Blackjack, Cookie, Flappy, Blocks, Climber and Rail Runner with server-side leaderboards |
| **Utilities** | Clock (alarms), Calendar, Notes (with sketches), Calculator, Compass, Health, Passwords, App Store, Settings |

## Highlights

- **Real accounts engine.** Social apps use actual registration and login, with verification codes and password resets delivered by in-game mail or SMS. Accounts are global, not per-character-slot.
- **Live game-view camera.** The Camera app renders the world into the phone screen in real time; video clips record your microphone and nearby players' voices.
- **Photogram Live.** Stream real encoded video to other players' phones, with clean late-joins.
- **Deep world integration.** Garages and Homes bridge across ten-plus garage and housing systems; Wallet reads your framework bank; Services maps jobs to callable, messageable companies; Weather mirrors the in-game sky.
- **Custom apps.** Other resources can put their own apps on the phone: one export call turns any webpage into an installable app with icons, badges, notifications, popups and an App Store listing. Custom apps built for lb-phone run unmodified. Start from the [app templates](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-app-templates) (plain JS, React JS/TS, Vue 3) and the [custom app guide](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/custom-apps).
- **lb-phone drop-in compatibility.** Third-party scripts written against lb-phone's exports and events keep working unmodified, and a one-command migrator imports lb-phone player data. See the [compatibility docs](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/lb-phone-compatibility).

## For developers

The phone ships a full integration surface, documented at [docs.samueldev.shop](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/):

- [Server exports](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/exports-server) for sending mail, messages and notifications, starting calls, managing contacts, resolving numbers to players, logging transactions, posting news, and more.
- [Client exports](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/exports-client) for opening the phone, deep-linking into apps, and gating phone use.
- [Custom apps](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/custom-apps) for shipping your own apps on the phone, with ready-made [templates](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-app-templates) for plain JS, React and Vue. Apps written for lb-phone register and run unmodified.
- [First-party events](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/events-server) on every lifecycle moment: messages, mail, calls, transactions, posts, contacts.
- [lb-phone compatibility](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/lb-phone-compatibility) covering exports, events, and `dependency 'lb-phone'` lines.

```lua
-- A taste: text a player from a job script
exports['sd-phone']:sendSystemMessage('555-0199', 'LS Dispatch', targetNumber, 'New tow request at Legion Square.')

-- React to any SMS being sent
AddEventHandler('sd-phone:server:messages:sent', function(m)
    print(('%s texted %s'):format(m.senderNumber, m.targetNumber))
end)
```

## Installation

Full guide: [docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/installation](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/installation)

**Dependencies:** [ox_lib](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_lib) · [oxmysql](https://github.com/CommunityOx/oxmysql) · [sd-phone-props](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-props) (streams the in-hand phone models)

1. Drop `sd-phone` and [`sd-phone-props`](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-props) into your resources folder and ensure them after `ox_lib` and `oxmysql`. Database tables create themselves on first boot.
2. Add the phone items to your inventory, one per frame colour (`phone_black`, `phone_blue`, `phone_green`, `phone_orange`, `phone_pink`, `phone_purple`, `phone_red`, `phone_yellow`). Ready-made ox_inventory definitions and item icons are in the [installation docs](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/installation); the icons ship in this repo's `images/` folder. Players can also open with the keybind (default F1), gated on owning a phone item.
3. Set your API keys in `configs/server/apikeys.lua`: a [Fivemanage](https://refer.fivemanage.com/samuel) token of type **Media** in `FivemanageMedia` (required for the Camera, Photos and Voice Memos apps to upload), and optionally a GIPHY key for the Messages GIF picker.

**Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone/releases)** (the packaged `sd-phone-*.zip`), not the green *Code -> Download ZIP*. The release zip carries the compiled UI and runs as-is; the source zip is code only and has no `web/build/`, so the phone opens blank.

Building from a git clone yourself: `cd web && npm ci && npm run build`. The output lands in the gitignored `web/build/`; the server logs a clear error on boot if it is missing.

## Unique Phones & SIM Cards (optional)

Off by default. Flip `Enabled = true` in `configs/simcards.lua` and phone numbers stop belonging to characters — they live on **SIM card items**. Whichever SIM is in a phone decides whose data that phone shows: messages, call log, contacts, photos, app logins, settings — everything. Steal someone's phone with the SIM inside and you're reading *their* phone; without any SIM, a phone opens to a **No SIM** screen with no service and every server action refused.

### Setup

1. Enable the feature in `configs/simcards.lua` and add the SIM item to your inventory (ox_inventory example):

   ```lua
   ['sim_card'] = {
       label = 'SIM Card',
       weight = 5,
       stack = false,
       close = true,
       consume = 0, -- required: sd-phone consumes the item itself on install
       server = { export = 'sd-phone.useSim_card' },
   },
   ```

2. Get SIMs to players — **no integration needed**: sell or spawn `sim_card` like any normal item (ox_inventory shop, loot table, `/give`, anything). A blank card **activates itself on first use**, minting and registering a fresh number on the spot; once activated the number stays on that card through every eject and reinsert. (`ActivateBlankSims = false` turns this off if you want SIM distribution controlled.)

   Optional paths for special cases:
   - `/givesim <playerId>` (admin) — a pre-activated SIM with a fresh number.
   - `/givesim <playerId> bind` — a **character-bound** SIM: it carries the player's existing number and their existing phone data, so servers switching the feature on lose nothing.
   - From another resource: `exports['sd-phone']:giveSimCard(source, { citizenid = cid })` for character-bound SIMs, or `{ number = '2085550123' }` to hardcode a specific number.
3. Phones handed out **before** enabling the feature keep working as items, but in container mode they have no SIM tray until re-issued.

### Two attach modes

| | `UseContainers = false` (default, universal) | `UseContainers = true` (ox_inventory only) |
|---|---|---|
| Install SIM | **Use the sim_card item** — it's consumed and written onto your phone | Right-click/use the phone → SIM tray opens → drag the SIM in |
| Eject SIM | Settings → **SIM & Backup** → *Eject SIM Card* (returns the item, number intact) | Drag the SIM out of the tray |
| Using the phone item | Opens the phone UI | Opens the SIM tray (ox intercepts container items); the phone UI opens via the keybind (default F1) |
| Backends | every supported backend below | ox_inventory |

Supported backends (via the slot-level bridge API in `bridge/server/inventory.lua`): **ox_inventory**, **qb-inventory**, **ps-inventory**, **lj-inventory**, **qs-inventory(-pro)**, **tgiann-inventory**, **codem-inventory**, **origen_inventory**, **jaksam_inventory**, plus a framework-native fallback for QBCore setups without a dedicated inventory. Plain ESX inventory has no item metadata and cannot support unique phones.

### Multiple phones & SIMs

A player can carry **several phones, each with its own SIM**. Whichever phone they open (use the item, or the keybind's last-used colour) is the **active** one — outgoing calls and messages act as that phone's number. All carried SIM'd phones stay **reachable**: a call or text to any of their numbers reaches the player, even while another phone is active. Settings → SIM & Backup lists the other phones on you.

### What players should know

- **No SIM = no service.** The phone opens but shows the No SIM screen; nothing works until a SIM is installed.
- **Your number lives on the SIM.** Move the SIM to another phone and the number (and the whole phone profile) moves with it. **A lost number is lost** — restores never bring numbers back.
- **Passcodes still protect you.** A thief sees your lockscreen; if you set a passcode they must know it — Face Unlock never works for anyone but the SIM's original owner.
- **Cloud Backup** (Settings → SIM & Backup) belongs to your **character** and is protected by a **backup password** you set when turning it on (a copy is saved into your Passwords app). After losing your phone, get a new phone + blank SIM, press *Restore from Backup* and enter the password: your contacts, messages, photos, notes, settings and app logins are copied to the new phone. The number is **not** restored — your new SIM keeps its own number, and the old number stays on the old SIM.

### SIM exports

```lua
-- Create + give a SIM card. opts.citizenid makes it character-bound (carries that
-- character's number/data); opts.number requests a specific number (nil if taken).
local number = exports['sd-phone']:giveSimCard(source, { citizenid = nil, number = nil })

exports['sd-phone']:getSimNumber(source)     -- bare-digit number in the player's ACTIVE phone, or nil
exports['sd-phone']:hasSim(source)           -- true when their active phone has a SIM
exports['sd-phone']:isSimModeActive()        -- true while unique phones are enabled + supported
exports['sd-phone']:isNumberAvailable(number) -- true when a number is free to assign

-- Assign a specific number to the SIM in the player's ACTIVE phone (identity/data kept).
-- This is the hook for your own "buy a custom number" implementation.
local ok, err = exports['sd-phone']:setSimNumber(source, '5550001234')
-- err on failure: 'invalid' | 'no_sim' | 'taken'
```

Existing number exports (`getPhoneNumber`, `getSourceByNumber`, `getIdentifierByNumber`, `isNumberInService`, `hasPhone`) automatically follow the SIM when the feature is on.

---

## Payphones (optional)

Street payphones let players call any number from the phone boxes around the map - no phone item needed. Walk up to a booth, target **Use Payphone**, punch the number in on the keypad and hit call. The booth plays the scripted payphone animation while you talk.

### Setup

Everything lives in `configs/payphone.lua`:

- `Enabled` - master switch; `false` removes the targets and disables every payphone callback.
- `Models` - the phone-box props that get the target interaction (works with ox_target, qb-target and qtarget through the built-in bridge).
- `UseOxLibMenu` - swap the payphone UI page for ox_lib context menus and an input dialog.
- `Anonymous` - when `true`, the person you call sees a withheld caller instead of the booth's number.
- `CallerLabel` - the name shown on the callee's incoming-call screen (their saved contacts still take priority).
- `ShowFavorites` - shows the player's favourite contacts (and their own number) on the booth's notepad for quick dialing.
- `NumberPrefix` - the area code minted payphone numbers start with.
- `Scene` - the on-the-phone animation clips; disable or reclip per game build.
- `Inbound` - calling a booth's number back rings the physical booth; anyone nearby can pick up via **Answer Phone**. Configure the ring timeout and bell sound here.

### Static numbers

Each booth mints a persistent number the first time it's used (stored in `phone_payphones`). The same street corner always calls out from the same number, so players can save it, recognise it - and call it back.

### Payphone exports

```lua
-- Opens the payphone dial UI at the player's position, for any script (client-side):
exports['sd-phone']:openPayphone()

-- True while the payphone UI is on screen (client-side):
exports['sd-phone']:isPayphoneOpen()
```
