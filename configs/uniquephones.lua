-- Unique phones (opt-in). When enabled, numbers come from sim_card items - or, with
-- BuiltInNumbers, from the phone itself (no SIM items at all). Who owns the DATA is DataOwner:
--
--   * DataOwner = 'device' (DEFAULT) - the PHONE owns the data, the SIM only lends a number.
--     Each phone item carries a persistent identity minted on first use, and that identity keys
--     everything (messages, contacts, photos, notes, settings, installed apps, games). Popping
--     a SIM out just drops your number/service: the phone still opens and every non-number app
--     keeps working. Moving a SIM to another phone hands that phone your NUMBER, not your data.
--
--   * DataOwner = 'sim' (LEGACY) - the SIM owns the data. Whichever SIM sits in a phone
--     decides WHOSE phone data you see; steal a phone with its SIM and you read the owner's
--     phone. Without a SIM the phone opens to a "No SIM" screen with no service and every
--     server action refused. This is the original unique-phones behaviour, byte-for-byte.
--
--   * DataOwner = 'character' - the STOCK data model with SIM numbers on top. Every phone
--     opens the holder's own character profile (a stolen phone shows the thief's data, never
--     the owner's), and without a SIM the character keeps a vanilla auto-assigned number with
--     full service. Installing a SIM changes ONLY the number; ejecting falls back to a fresh
--     auto number. Enabling this on an existing stock server keeps everyone's data untouched.
--
-- With 'device'/'sim' the number follows the SIM, and the Cloud Backup section in Settings
-- lets a player carry their data to a new phone (the number stays behind on the old SIM).
--
-- Backend support: reading/writing per-slot item metadata is required. Supported out of the box:
--   * ox_inventory              (metadata mode, or the physical SIM-tray container mode below)
--   * qb-inventory / ps / lj    (metadata mode via the QBCore item `info` table)
-- Other inventories (qs / tgiann / codem / origen / jaksam) need a small adapter in
-- server/sim/inv.lua; plain ESX inventory has no item metadata and cannot support this feature.

    -- Where the phone DATA lives: 'device' | 'sim' | 'character' (see the header above).
    -- Flipping an existing 'sim' server to 'device' is safe: on first use each phone ADOPTS the

    -- from then on does the number float free of the data. (The pre-DataOwner boolean
    -- `DeviceIdentity` is still honoured when this key is absent.)

    -- the tray (ox intercepts container items client-side), so the phone UI itself only opens
