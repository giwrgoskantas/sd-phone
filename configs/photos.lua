-- Photos / Camera. The Camera app renders the live game view into a NUI canvas (vendored
-- three.js + CfxTexture in web/src/render/) for a first-person viewfinder. The shutter
-- grabs that canvas as a base64 data-URL and sends it to the server over a latent event
-- (server/photos/init.lua), which uploads it to Fivemanage and stores only the returned
-- CDN URL in `phone_photos`.

-- The Fivemanage Media key is read SERVER-SIDE so it never reaches clients: set FivemanageMedia
-- in configs/server/apikeys.lua (that file is excluded from fxmanifest files{}). A blank config
-- value still falls back to the legacy `sd_fivemanage_key` server convar. Create a "Media" token
-- at https://app.fivemanage.com.
